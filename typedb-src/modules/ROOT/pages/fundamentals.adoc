more detail on the topics.

== TypeDB server and client

//What is TypeDB
TypeDB:: DBMS software with polymorphism, strong type system, fully declarative query language, and reasoning engine.

//TypeDB editions
There are three editions of the software: Cloud, Enterprise, and Core.
All editions support the same set of query types and TypeQL syntax.

For more information on differences between TypeDB editions,
see the https://typedb.com/deploy[Deploy] page of our website.

//client-server architecture
//client role
TypeDB uses https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-protocol[TypeDB protocol], based on https://grpc.io/[gRPC],
to communicate queries and responses.

TypeDB Client:: Any software capable of communicating with TypeDB through TypeDB protocol.

TypeDB Driver:: A language-specific library that implements TypeDB protocol and provides TypeDB Driver API.
TypeDB Drivers are usually used to create TypeDB Clients, including
xref:clients::studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio,window=_blank] and xref:clients::console.adoc[TypeDB Console,window=_blank].

== Database

//database data separation
TypeDB stores data in databases.

Every database has a name, schema, and data.

For more information on how to create a database, see the xref:development/connect.adoc#_databases[Databases] section
on the xref:development/connect.adoc[] page.

//storage
//Physical persistent storage is implemented with https://www.speedb.io/[SpeedDB].

=== Schema
//schema

Schema:: A database schema is a full set of definitions for all types and rules, used in the database.

Schema is like a blueprint of data in a database.

//types
Type:: A template for creating data instances.

A type is like a class for an object in OOP programming languages.

A new type can be defined by subtyping an existing type.
Subtype inherits constraints and properties of its supertype.
Any type has exactly one supertype.

A brand-new database with an empty schema has built-in root types: `entity`, `relation`, and `attribute`.
All user-defined types in a schema are direct or indirect subtypes of these root types.

include::typeql::fundamentals.adoc[tag=entity_type_definition]

include::typeql::fundamentals.adoc[tag=relation_type_definition]

include::typeql::fundamentals.adoc[tag=attribute_type_definition]

//rules
A rule represents logic embedded in a schema.
Rules are used by reasoning engine to infer new data, based on patterns, found in existing data.

=== Data
//Instance of a type

To insert any data in a TypeDB database, we instantiate a type, defined in a database's schema.

All inserted data should be compliant with constraints from a schema of a database it is inserted to.

Retrieving data from a database can result in getting values directly, but more often it includes dealing with concepts,
returned by a TypeDB Driver through Driver API.

//Concept
Concept:: Either type or an instance of a type.

TypeDB Driver API has methods to process concepts.

//Value

== Connection

//client
To send a query to TypeDB, we need to do the following:

. Establish a network connection between a TypeDB Client and a TypeDB server or a cluster.
. Open a session to a database.
. Open a transaction.

To establish a network connection, we need a server address, including the port that the server is listening to.
//For clusters (available in Enterprise and CLoud editions) we also need username, password, and CA certificate for TLS.
TypeDB usually uses a single connection to a single TypeDB server or cluster.

//session
//Without a session, we can establish a session, create a new database or delete an existing one.
To open a session, we need a database name and a session type: `schema` or `data`.
You can open more than one session to a database, but there are some limitations for the
xref:development/acid-guarantees.adoc#_schema_integrity[schema integrity].

For more information on how to open a session, see the xref:development/connect.adoc#_sessions[sessions]
section on the xref:development/connect.adoc[] page.

//transaction
//Without a transaction we can
To open a transaction, we need a transaction type: `read` or `write`.
You can open more than one transaction in a session, but transactions have a time limit of 5 minutes by default.

For more information on how to open a transaction, see the xref:development/connect.adoc#_transactions[sessions]
section on the xref:development/connect.adoc[] page.

== Query

All queries to a TypeDB database are written in TypeQL.

TypeQL is a *declarative* query language.

include::typeql::queries.adoc[tag=queries_table]

For more information on query types, read the xref:typeql::queries.adoc[] page.

== Pattern matching

TypeDB xref:typedb::fundamentals/queries.adoc[queries] are written in xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL]
and use *patterns* to manipulate the schema and data of a database.

A pattern is a set of statements.
By default, conjunction combines all statements.
Disjunction and negation can be used explicitly.

.See example
[%collapsible]
====
image::example-pattern.png[Complex example]

The pattern is a conjunction of five different pattern types:

. *Conjunction 1* specifies the variables for two `person` instances, their `full-names`, `action`, and `file` that
  has path `README.md`, specifies their types.
. *Disjunction* specifies that the actions of interest are either `modify_file` or `view_file`.
. *Negation 1* specifies that person `$p1` shall not have `full-name` with value of `Masako Holley`.
. *Negation 2* specifies that person `$p2` shall not have `full-name` with value of `Masako Holley`.
. *Conjunction 2* specifies that the `file` has `access` with the `action` that we specified earlier,
  and both instances of the `person` to have the `permission` to the specified `access`.

In short, the above example finds pairs of people who both have permission to access the same file
with a path of `README.md`. The pattern additionally specifies the access to be either `modify_file` or `view_file`,
and neither people to have the full-name `Masako Holley`.
