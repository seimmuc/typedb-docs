This page explains basic TypeDB terminology and operations required for anyone to continue learning how to use TypeDB.

== TypeDB

TypeDB is a transactional DBMS with xref:typedb::development/acid-guarantees.adoc[],
that uses TypeQL as its query language.

//What is TypeDB
TypeDB: :: DBMS software with polymorphism, strong type system, fully declarative query language, and reasoning engine.

TypeQL: :: Declarative query language used by TypeDB.

=== TypeDB server and cluster

TypeDB is a server-side software, used to manage databases and process queries written in TypeQL.

//TypeDB editions
TypeDB has three editions: TypeDB Cloud, TypeDB Enterprise, and TypeDB Core.
All editions support the same set of query types and the same TypeQL syntax.
TypeDB Core can only be used for creating singular servers of TypeDB.
While other editions support clustering, replicating, load-balancing, encryption, etc.

For more information on differences between TypeDB editions,
see the https://typedb.com/deploy[Deploy] page of our website.

=== TypeDB Clients

//client-server architecture
//client role
To connect to a TypeDB, one can use a TypeDB Client.
TypeDB Clients are capable of sending a query to TypeDB server or cluster and retrieving an answer.
TypeDB uses https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-protocol[TypeDB protocol], based on https://grpc.io/[gRPC],
to communicate queries and responses with TypeDB Clients.

TypeDB Client: :: Any software capable of communicating with TypeDB through the TypeDB protocol.

A TypeDB Client can be built with an existing library that implements TypeDB Protocol and provides a native API
for interacting with TypeDB, queries, and answers.
We call such a library a TypeDB Driver.

TypeDB Driver: :: A language-specific library that implements the TypeDB protocol and provides a TypeDB Driver API.

TypeDB Drivers are used to create other TypeDB Clients, such as
xref:clients:ROOT:studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio,window=_blank] and
xref:clients:ROOT:console.adoc[TypeDB Console,window=_blank].

== Database

//database data separation
TypeDB stores data in databases.
Every database has a name and consists of schema and data.
Schema is like a blueprint of data in a database.
One can define constraints on data and rules for reasoning in a schema.

Database: :: A named collection of data with a schema.

Schema: :: A database schema is a full set of definitions for all types and rules used in the database.

A TypeDB server/cluster can store multiple databases, but is optimized for a small number of databases per server/cluster.
It is best to keep the number of databases in any given installation **under 10**.

For more information on how to create and manage databases, see the
xref:development/send-queries.adoc#_databases[Databases] section on the
xref:development/send-queries.adoc[] page.

//storage
//Physical persistent storage is implemented with https://www.speedb.io/[SpeedDB].

=== Type

A type for data is like a class for an object in OOP programming languages.
A type is also a category for classification of data instances.
All constraints defined for a type are applied for all instances of this type.
Whenever we insert some data into a TypeDB database we create instances of types,
existing in the schema of the database.

//types
Type: :: A template for creating a data instance.

A new type can be defined by subtyping an existing type.
Subtype inherits constraints and properties of its supertype.
Any type has exactly one supertype.

A brand-new database with an empty schema has built-in root types: `entity`, `relation`, and `attribute`.
All user-defined types in a schema are direct or indirect subtypes of these root types.

include::typeql:ROOT:fundamentals.adoc[tag=entity_type_definition]

include::typeql:ROOT:fundamentals.adoc[tag=relation_type_definition]

include::typeql:ROOT:fundamentals.adoc[tag=attribute_type_definition]

For more information on schema types, see the xref:typeql:ROOT:fundamentals.adoc#_types[Types] section on the
xref:typeql:ROOT:fundamentals.adoc[] page of the xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL] documentation.

//rules
Rules represent logic embedded in a schema.
Rules are used by reasoning engine to infer new data, based on patterns, found in existing data.

Rule: :: A combination of a condition and a conclusion, defined in a database schema
         and used by the TypeDB reasoning engine to infer new data.

For more information on rules, see the xref:typeql:ROOT:fundamentals.adoc#_rules[Rules] section on the
xref:typeql:ROOT:fundamentals.adoc[] page of the xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL] documentation.

=== Data
//Instance of a type

To insert any data in a TypeDB database, we instantiate a type, defined in a database's schema.
All inserted data should be compliant with constraints from a schema of a database it is inserted to.
Retrieving data from a database can result in getting values directly, but more often it includes dealing with concepts,
returned by a TypeDB Driver through Driver API.

//Concept
Concept: :: Either a type or an instance of a type in a TypeDB database.

TypeDB Driver API has methods to process concepts.
For more information on Driver API concept methods, see the relevant Driver API reference:

* xref:clients:ROOT:java/java-api-ref.adoc#_concept_methods[Java]
* xref:clients:ROOT:python/python-api-ref.adoc#_concept_methods[Python]
* xref:clients:ROOT:node-js/node-js-api-ref.adoc#_concept_methods[Node.js]

== Connection

//client
To send a query to TypeDB, we need to do the following:

. Establish a network connection between a TypeDB Client and a TypeDB server or a cluster.
. Open a session to a database.
. Open a transaction.

image::clients::concurrency-model.png[Session-transaction-query,link=self,width=100%]

To establish a network connection, we need an address of a server or cluster, including the port.
//For clusters (available in Enterprise and CLoud editions) we also need username, password, and CA certificate for TLS.
//TypeDB usually uses a single connection to a single TypeDB server or cluster.

//session
[#_learn_session]
A session is like a tunnel connection to a database in a TypeDB server or cluster.
To open a session, we need a database name and a session type.
There are two types of sessions in TypeDB: `schema` and `data`.
Use session types according to their names.
A good principle to follow is for logically coherent transactions to be grouped into a single session.

You can open more than one session to a database.
You can read data and schema with any type of session,
but to modify data or schema you must use the correct session type.
To learn more about limitations on sessions and transactions, see the
xref:development/acid-guarantees.adoc#_schema_integrity[schema integrity,window=_blank] section.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is recommended to avoid long-running sessions, because of possible network failures.
====

[NOTE]
====
Any TypeDB Client will regularly exchange internal signals with the server to keep the session alive when it's open.
The default timeout is 30 seconds.
====

For more information on how to open a session, see the xref:development/send-queries.adoc#_sessions[sessions]
section on the xref:development/send-queries.adoc[] page.

//transaction
[#_learn_transaction]
//Without a transaction we can
To open a transaction, we need a transaction type: `read` or `write`.
You can open more than one transaction in a session, but transactions have a time limit of 5 minutes by default.
For more information on how to open a transaction, see the xref:development/send-queries.adoc#_transactions[transactions]
section on the xref:development/send-queries.adoc[] page.

Choose an appropriate session type and queries to write schema or data:

[cols="^,^,^,^,^",options="header"]
|===
| Session type | Reading data | Writing data | Reading schema | Writing schema

| DATA
| Yes
| Yes
| Yes
h| *No*

| SCHEMA
| Yes
h| *No*
| Yes
| Yes
|===

== Query

All queries to a TypeDB database are written in TypeQL.
TypeQL is a *fully declarative* query language that can be used as both
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language[DDL] and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language[DML].

include::typeql:ROOT:queries.adoc[tag=queries_table]

For more information on query types, read the xref:typeql:ROOT:queries.adoc[] page.

//There are different ways to send a query to a TypeDB database, depending on what TypeDB Client is used.
//For more information on how to send a query, see the xref:typedb::development/send-queries.adoc[] page.

== Pattern matching

TypeDB xref:typeql:ROOT:fundamentals/queries.adoc[queries] are written in xref:typeql:ROOT:overview.adoc[TypeQL]
and use *patterns* to manipulate schema and data of a database.

A pattern is a set of statements.
By default, conjunction combines all statements.
Disjunction and negation can be used explicitly.

=== Example

image::example-pattern.png[Complex example]

The pattern is a conjunction of five different pattern types:

. *Conjunction 1* specifies the variables for two `person` instances, their `full-names`, `action`, and `file` that
  has path `README.md`, specifies their types.
. *Disjunction* specifies that the actions of interest are either `modify_file` or `view_file`.
. *Negation 1* specifies that person `$p1` shall not have `full-name` with value of `Masako Holley`.
. *Negation 2* specifies that person `$p2` shall not have `full-name` with value of `Masako Holley`.
. *Conjunction 2* specifies that the `file` has `access` with the `action` that we specified earlier,
  and both instances of the `person` to have the `permission` to the specified `access`.

In short, the above example finds pairs of people who both have permission to access the same file
with a path of `README.md`. The pattern additionally specifies the access to be either `modify_file` or `view_file`,
and neither people to have the full-name `Masako Holley`.
