== Where to go from here?

For a quick glance on TypeDB capabilities and features, see the
xref:introduction.adoc[]
page.

To set up your first TypeDB database environment, use the
xref:install-and-run.adoc[installation guide]
to install a local server or deploy to TypeDB Cloud.

Then use our
xref:quickstart-guide.adoc[]
for hands-on experience: create your first database and try some queries.

Upon setting up a working TypeDB environment, we recommend to explore the following documentation subsections:

* xref:development/learn-basics.adoc[] -- compressed essential knowledge about TypeDB;
* <<_developing_with_typedb,Developing with TypeDB>> section -- how-to guides to database connection, queries and best practice;
* <<_managing_typedb,Managing TypeDB>> section -- configuring local and TypeDB Cloud deployments;
* <<_tutorials,Tutorials>> section -- tutorials, how-to guides, and the xref:tutorials/iam-schema.adoc[].

Check our documentation for xref:clients::clients.adoc[TypeDB Clients] and xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL].
