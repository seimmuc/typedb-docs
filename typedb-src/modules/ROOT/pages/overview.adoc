== Where to go from here?

For a birds-eye view of the TypeDB features, see the xref:introduction.adoc[] page.

For a more practical approach — xref:install-and-run/install.adoc[install] a TypeDB server locally or
xref:typedb::install-and-run/deploy-in-cloud.adoc[deploy] an instance of TypeDB in TypeDB Cloud
and use our xref:quickstart/studio.adoc[] to set up a TypeDB environment to explore its capabilities.

Upon setting up a working TypeDB environment, we recommend to explore the following documentation subsections:

* *Fundamentals* -- essential knowledge about TypeDB;
* *Development* -- documentation of the TypeDB development workflow;
* *Cloud deployments* -- setting up a cloud (DBaaS) deployment;
* *Self-hosted deployments* -- setting up a local server environment;
* *Tutorials* -- how-to guides and the xref:tutorials/iam-schema.adoc[].

There are separate documentation sections for:

* xref:clients::clients.adoc[TypeDB Clients] -- TypeDB Studio, TypeDB Console, and TypeDB Drivers;
* xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL] -- TypeDB's query language.
